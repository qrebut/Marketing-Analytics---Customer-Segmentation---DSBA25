# Credit Card Customer Segmentation Project

## Overview
This project performs an unsupervised machine learning analysis (K-Means Clustering) on a dataset of 8800 credit card customers. The goal is to identify distinct customer segments and recommend appropriate credit limits for each group to optimize bank strategy and risk management.

## Project Structure
- `notebook.ipynb`: The main analysis file containing EDA, Preprocessing, Clustering, and Statistical Analysis.
- `app.py`: A Streamlit dashboard for interactive use by bank managers.
- `CreditCard_STM.csv`: The dataset used for training.
- `*.pkl`: Serialized models (Scaler, KMeans, Mappings) generated by the notebook.

## Key Segments Identified
1. **VIP / Big Spenders**: High purchase frequency and amounts. High credit limit recommended.
2. **Cash Advancers**: Users who frequently take cash advances. Riskier segment; controlled limits.
3. **High Balance / Revolvers**: Users keeping high balances and paying minimums. No limit increase recommended.
4. **Low Activity / Frugal**: Low usage. Moderate limits to encourage engagement.

## How to Run
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn streamlit plotly

2. **Display the Dashboard**! 
    Open a Terminal and execute : streamlit run app.py
